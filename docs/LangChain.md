# LangChain
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It's
intended to simplify every step of the LLM application lifecycle.
* Development: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source building blocks, components, and third-party integrations. Use LangGraph.js to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
* Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
* Deployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Cloud.
